I made this for a server just for fun

Not completed, need SlimeFrame, supports 1.16.5(and above? maybe), NOT FULLY TESTED
- if u want to translate, find /main/resources/language, create one like"en_US.properties", copy and change words from 'zh_CN.properties',<font color=yellow>then tweak config and DO compile</font>

- Alert for using source code: used tweaked SlimeFun from <a href=https://github.com/StarWishsama/Slimefun4> HERE</a>

(Maybe U can try your own slimefun, i didn't remember i used anything they tweaked )

(给一个公益服写的,没写完,只加了三把枪
要先加SlimeFrame,用了汉(mo)化(gai)过的<a hre=https://github.com/StarWishsama/Slimefun4>Slimefun</a>,但是应该原来的也能用,不过你得自己编译.
支持1.16.5,高版本没试过)
## Thanks
